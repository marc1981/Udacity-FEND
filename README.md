## This repository contains all of the projects that were completed for [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.

Profile and Portfolio can be found [here](https://profiles.udacity.com/u/marcanderson).

## List of projects:
1. **Project 0:** A very simple website. The purpose of this was to introduce the student to some of the basics of HTML and CSS as well as a few of the principles of design and layout.
2. **Project 1:** A mock portfolio. This was created as a demo version of an actual portfolio. Again, it was a way to familiarize the student with design and layout, bu this time it introduced Bootstrap and jQuery.
3. **Project 2:** Online resume. Using jQuery, a resume was made that included a Google map showing the locations where the student works and lives.
4. **Project 3:** JavaScript game. Making this game required an understanding of Object Oriented Programming, and it also incorporated elements of graphic design in making the character sprites and background.
5. **Project 4:** Web optimization. This project was all about minimizing load times and maximizing performance on a range devices (desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).
6. **Project 5:** Interactive map. This web-based app makes use of the Google Map API and also makes a `GET` request to U.S. Census Bureau in order to obtain the necessary data.
7. **Project 6:** Feed reader testing. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework, [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). A web-based, RSS feed-reader was subjected to a series of pass-fail test suites in order to ensure its functionality.
